---------- README ----------

In this Rush Project, We need to create a little game based on TD's.
It's a game where monsters are coming by a side and try to go out by another one

For everyone who don't know this game, just refere you to : man Warcraft (3).
(and there are a lot of on internet, coded like we are trying to code it)

You have to know that this projet has been done in 36 hours, without sleeping.
So, let's be indulgent on your appreciation.

We tried to do the best, we a lot of ideas, but it was really hard to implemente


So, to compile your executable you have to:

These are the steps to do in your bash:
./configure : It's going to compile your makefile.rules for the Makefile
make && make clean : create your executable and delete them respectively
make dist : creating a tarball to export your game and functions

To execute your executables, just do: ./<name>

To create the latex and pdf of everything on the project:
make doc

Have fun, and try to continue it if you want to.
